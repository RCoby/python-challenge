## #1 PyBank

This Python code reads in a budget data CSV file, calculates and prints financial metrics, and exports results to both the console and a text file.

-----

### The financial metrics calculated and printed include:

+ Total number of months included in the dataset
+ Net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
+ Changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
+ Greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
+ Greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

-----

The results are printed to the console using the print() function, and also exported to a text file in the "analysis" folder using the built-in open() and write() functions.
